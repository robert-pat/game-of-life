# Plans of what to add:
-- 1. move game control to new file (?)
  a) maybe just refactor a little
  b) how do other rust ppl do this
  c) kinda feels like its getting cramped --

--2. move setup to a function call--

--3. add a loop for terminal controls
  a) Set specific cells to living or dead
  b) Run n iterations of the board
  c) Print out the current board --

4. ability to run commands at the same time, eg "p 1,1" as one cmd
  a) probably involved re-doing the main loop
  b) idk what kind of parsing to do here

--5. Handle errors in int parsing; the unwrap() function --

--6. move string coordinate parsing to regex, (easier to handle parsing errors ?) --

7. Add the ability to read coordinates from a file instead of only typing them

8. Condense sub-menus
