# A Simulator for Conway's Game of Life
### Written in Rust
### Command line only
### Intended as a stand-alone "game" of sorts

A command line program for playing with different boards of Conway's Game of Life. 
This project was intended as a way to learn Rust and perform some basic operations. 
The code should be complete, but I havn't really tested any large or functional boards (I probably won't).
